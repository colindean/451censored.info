    %h1 451 Unavailable For Legal Reasons
    %p 
      This page is unavailable for no particular reason, other than as a test of
      <a href="/">HTTP 451</a>. Had this been a real unavailble for legal reasons
      notice, it would probably sound a lot scarier.
    %p
      Note that this response may lack a description in the HTTP status line due
      to <a href="https://github.com/colindean/451censored.info/issues/1">Rack
      not having HTTP 451 support</a> yet.
